## Satisfactory Trainer — When Order Learns to Breathe

Belts hum like rivers of steel.
Assemblers whisper their endless math.
And somewhere between iron ore and infinity, you stand — architect of logic.

The **Satisfactory Trainer** is not a shortcut through creation. It is a *metronome*. A way to steady the rhythm of progress when the factory grows louder than your thoughts.

Designed for pioneers of **Satisfactory**, this trainer refines the experience of building at scale, reducing repetition while preserving the beautiful complexity that defines the game.

## 🧭 Overview — What This Trainer Actually Is

This software operates as a **real-time control layer**, attaching only while the game runs. It does not rewrite saves or overwrite files — it simply listens to the factory’s pulse and lets you guide it.

**Guiding principles:**

* Accelerate creativity, not chaos
* Remove friction, not depth
* Offer full control with instant rollback

Think of it as a drafting table beside your megabase — always available, never intrusive.

## ⚙️ Production & Factory Flow Control

In Satisfactory, time is the true resource.

The production module lets you bend it — gently.

**Core factory features include:**

* Production speed multipliers ⚙️
* Instant crafting & building
* No power consumption toggle
* Machine efficiency overrides
* Conveyor throughput tuning

Sliders replace blunt switches, allowing subtle acceleration instead of runaway imbalance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Speed multipliers can be applied per-machine to avoid destabilizing large production chains.

* Fall damage disable

Perfect for megabase planning, creative layouts, or stress-free exploration of distant biomes.

## 👁 Resource Visibility & Planning Insight

A factory grows blind without data.

## ❓ FAQ — Questions Between Shifts

**Is the trainer safe to use?**
Yes, for singleplayer and offline sessions. It operates in memory only.

**Will it break factory balance?**
Only if overused. Most players apply small boosts to reduce downtime, not eliminate planning.

**Can I turn everything off instantly?**
Yes — one panic hotkey restores vanilla behavior.

**Does it affect saves permanently?**
No. Changes can be session-only unless you choose otherwise.

**Are updates frequent?**
Yes. Compatibility updates follow major Satisfactory patches.

It is about *understanding*.

The **Satisfactory Trainer** does not replace planning — it clears the noise around it. Giving you space to think, to design, to let the factory grow like a living system rather than a chore.

Belts aligned.
Power stable.
Your vision — uninterrupted.
